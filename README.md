# dhcp
Python version of DHCP


# Overview
I decided I wanted to take some of my free time to create DHCP in python.  I
landed a new position within the company of HPE.  Because of the new position
is a internal move within the company, I'm having to wait ~2 months in order to
actually start the position.  In the meantime, I've been browsing the departments
jira documents.   Found their Kanban board which lead me to a task that they want
to develop DHCP for their router.

Mostly I am doing this project because I want to get acclamiated with VIM as my
my IDE and I wanted to find a useful project that I can start getting into the
mind set of being a 'Network' Software Engineer.   I guess this project will
bring back some nostalgia of my CS undergrad 'Computer Networks' course.

But again, mostly, I want to be fluent in VIM and python so I can strictly focus
on the tasks at hand.
